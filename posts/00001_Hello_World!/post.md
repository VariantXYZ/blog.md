Copied over my Cohost intro post below since it covers me for the most part <small>(not me waiting until the very last minute to copy things over from Cohost)</small>, but my hope with this blog was to serve as a place to help get me to write thoughts down so I can reference them later starting in this upcoming 2025.

The added bonus of figuring out what goes into frontend web development is nice too.

<summary>*Cohost Intro Post*</summary>
I'm known in a few places as Variant, and my hope is that this'll serve as a useful intro pinned post.

I enjoy games, but don't actually have time to play too many of them. I tend to pick up and drop games if they don't grab me, so a lot of the ones I finish tend to be fairly special to me. Sometimes I'll come across a series or game that I really like and want to make better, or at least more palatable to myself, and so I tend to do a lot of reverse engineering projects...

In recent years, this has been a myriad of various Gameboy romhacking projects, like the [Medabots GB translations](https://github.com/Medabots) (of which 1 and 3 are done, the rest are TBD), or throwing [VWF into Dragon Warrior 3](https://github.com/VariantXYZ/dragon-warrior-3-gbc).

I eventually want to translate a lesser known Link's Awakening-esque game called [Metamode](https://koei.fandom.com/wiki/Metamode) as well, but that'll be a task for another day.

In past years, I worked on enabling translations for Phantasy Star Online 2 back when it came out, among other things. I was indirectly responsible for providing a way to track damage and healing metrics too.

A longer time ago, I actually was really into Ragnarok Online and the super high rate private server scene too. I had administrated more populated servers, but my favorite was definitely the last one I was involved in called RidiculouslyRO. A friend and I worked on it together and I think it was definitely something special. We went balls to the wall with Big Numbers and customization and even implemented solo instancing way before it was mainlined into the server emulator projects at the time...

And that's what I remember.

<sub>Realizing as I'm typing my first blog post that I forgot to support images... </sub>

<sub>More importantly, because everything is in a flat structure, it's definitely going to be a pain to properly isolate images per post... but maybe I can just call it a feature and have a common image directory.</sub>
